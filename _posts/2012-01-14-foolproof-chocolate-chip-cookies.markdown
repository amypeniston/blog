*Really, truly, the only cookie recipe you'll ever need.*


> 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 egg yolk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (as desired)

* Preheat oven to 325°F. 
* Grease cookie sheets with cooking spray.
* Beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
* Mix in egg, yolk and vanilla.
* In a separate bowl, stir together dry ingredients. 
* Blend dry ingredients into wet mixture. Don’t overbeat!
* Stir in chocolate chips.
* Form balls of dough (1-2 tablespoons) and place on sheets. 
* Bake 17 minutes or until just firm to the touch. Cookies will not appear fully baked- this is OK! They will remain deliciously soft and chewy when slightly underbaked. Leave cookies on sheets for 2-3 minutes, then remove to racks to cool fully.

Mix it up by stirring in coconut flakes, white chocolate chips or m&ms.
