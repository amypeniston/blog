*These oven baked flautas are stuffed with spicy adobo-flavored chicken and topped with a dollop of guacamole.*

> 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts      
> 1 tablespoon olive oil      
> salt & pepper to taste      
> 1 large onion, minced      
> 1 tablespoon olive oil      
> 6 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed      
> 8 ounces cream cheese      
> 3-5 tablespoons of adobo sauce, depending on how hot you want it (take from a can of [chipotle peppers packed in adobo sauce](https://www.google.com/search?q=adobo+chile&espv=2&biw=1396&bih=718&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWnuOMjN_NAhVC5IMKHTQUDRcQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=adobo+chile+can))      
> 2 chipotle peppers, finely chopped (optional, if you like heat)      
> 1 tablespoon garlic powder      
> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika      
> 1 teaspoon onion powder      
> 1/3 cup water      
> small flour tortillas      
> shredded cheese of your choosing      
> optional extra toppings: chopped cilantro, sliced jalepeños, diced red onion, diced scallions, sour cream, guacamole (see recipe, below), chipotle dressing, hot sauce      

* Pan fry the chicken breasts in olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
* Remove chicken from pan to rest. Cut chicken into smaller 1/2"-1" thick pieces.
* Wipe pan clean and fry onion and garlic in olive oil until fragrant.
* Meanwhile spray inside of slow cooker with Pam (this helps with cleanup). Into the slow cooker place: chicken, onions and garlic, cream cheese, adobo sauce, chipotle peppers (if desired), garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika and water.
* Slow cook on low for 3-5 hours. Periodically stir to incorporate all of the flavors and break the chicken into smaller pieces. You can also use a fork to shred the chicken if desired.
* When ready to eat, preheat the oven to 350°F. Assemble each flauta with a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture and top with whatever toppings suit your fancy. The cheese acts as the cement to hold it all together when the flautas are baked. 
* Roll the filled flautas, making sure to seal both ends or the cheese will ooze out. Bake for ~10 minutes until slightly golden and firm to the touch.
* Enjoy with guacamole, sour cream and hot sauce.
