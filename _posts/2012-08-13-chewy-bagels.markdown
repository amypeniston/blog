“I cannot believe I just made bagels from scratch!”

> 1 1/2 cup warm water (110-115°F)  
1 tablespoon active yeast (1 package)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon molasses
2 teaspoons salt
4 cups unbleached bread flour (to consistency)
water
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon salt

Toppings of your choice: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, minced garlic, powdered garlic, minced onion, powdered onion, caraway seeds, coarse salt, grated cheese, parmesan, corn meal, cinnamon, raisins

* In a large plastic or wooden bowl combine warm water, yeast and sugar. Let stand 5 minutes until yeast has bloomed.
* Whisk in oil, molasses and one cup of flour. Add salt and combine. Continue adding flour bit by bit, switching to a wooden spoon when dough becomes tough. Try to shoot for the perfect median between sticky and dry.
* Knead dough in bowl or on floured surface for 10 to 12 minutes until smooth and cohesive. Place in bowl and cover with a cloth. Let rise 15 minutes.
* Divide dough into 8 pieces and form each section into 10″ rolls. Roll the ends together to make rings and place on a floured surface to let rise, covered, for 20 minutes. Don’t skimp on the flour here, as they have a tendency to stick and will be very deformed if you have to pry them loose!
* Meanwhile, fill a pot with water and bring to a boil. Add molasses and salt.
* Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle with corn meal if desired. This gives them a gritty texture and a more “rustic” taste.
* Place a cooking cloth next to your oven and get ready to boil the bagels! * Being very gentle, lower 2 bagels at a time into the boiling water and simmer for 45 seconds. Flip them over and let sit again for another 45 seconds.
* Using a slotted spoon transfer the bagels to the cloth to dry slightly.
Repeat for the other bagels, 45 seconds to each side.
* Place bagels on the lined baking sheets and transfer to oven. Immediately turn down the temperature to 425°F.
* Bake for 20-25 minutes. When almost done, use tongs to flip bagels and ensure both sides are cooked fully.
* Let bagels cool on cooling racks. Slice and enjoy.
* Cut bagels in half and freeze to preserve that freshly baked taste.
