*Break off a hunk and dunk it in a steaming cup of coffee.*

> 2 cups flour      
> 1/4 cup white sugar    
> 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder    
> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda    
> 1/4 teaspoon salt    
> 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter, cut into small pieces    
> 3/4 cup chocolate chips    
> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract    
> 3/4 cup buttermilk (Don’t have buttermilk? Combine regular milk stand with a few drops of white vinegar and let stand for 10 minutes)    

* Preheat oven to 400ºF.
* Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
* Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbles. Don’t overdo it!
* Stir in chocolate chips.
* Whisk vanilla into buttermilk, then add the combined mixture to the dry ingredients.
* Stir just until combined, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface to knead 5-7 times. Pat into a 7″ round. Cut into quarters, then in half again.
* Place the 8 scones on parchment paper on a baking sheet. Dab each with a bit of milk and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.
* Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
