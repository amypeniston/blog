*Give these to a sweet-lover and see if they can guess what's in 'em. Guaranteed they'll be surprised.*

*Recipe modified from [The Healthy Hour](http://thehealthyhour.com/2016/05/raw-caramel-slice/)*

**Cookie Dough Base**

> 1 cup unsalted cashews, soaked for 4 hours in water     
> 2/3 cup oats     
> 2/3 cup coconut flakes     
> 5 medjool dates, pitted and soaked in warm water for a few minutes     
> dash of almond extract (or vanilla, whatever you prefer)     
> pinch of salt     

**Caramel Filling**

> 14 medjool dates, pitted     
> 1/3 cup almond butter     
> 2 tablespoons maple syrup     
> 1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted     
> 1 tsp vanilla extract     
> pinch of salt      

**Chocolate Layer**

> 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted     
> 1/3 cup cacao power     
> 3 tablespoons maple syrup     
> 1 tablespoon honey     
> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract     
> pinch of salt     

* Add cashews, oats, coconut flakes, extract and salt to a food processor and blend for 2 minutes until the ingredients are finely ground.
* Add in the soaked dates and blend until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and sticky, if not add a tablespoon or two of warm water and process again.
* Line loaf pan with parchment paper. Press base dough into the pan and spread evenly. Cover pan with aluminum foil and place in freezer.
* Clean the food processor and then add to it the caramel ingredients: dates, almond butter, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla and salt. Process for 2 minutes until it looks like caramel, adding a tablespoon of water if it doesn't seem creamy enough.
* Take pan out of freezer, layer caramel over the base, then return it to the freezer.
* Whisk the cacao power, maple syrup, honey, vanilla and salt into the melted coconut oil until it is smooth and glossy.
* Remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over top of the caramel filling and return to freezer for another 4-6 hours.
* Slice and enjoy. Store in freezer.
