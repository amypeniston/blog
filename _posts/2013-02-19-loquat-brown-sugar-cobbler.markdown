*February is the perfect time of year to rally the troops, fill a few bags with loquat fruit and cook up a bubbly, chunky loquat cobbler.*

Filling:

> ~ 5 cups loquats, seeded, cleaned and quartered  
> ~ 3/4 cup white sugar (adjust to taste)         
> ~1/4 cup brown sugar (adjust to taste)         
> 2 teaspoons cinnamon       
> 1 teaspoon nutmeg       
> juice of one lemon       

Topping:

> 3/4 cup flour  
> 1 teaspoon baking powder      
> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda      
> 1/2 teaspoon salt      
> 3 tablespoons white sugar      
> 2 teaspoons cinnamon      
> 1/2 cup buttermilk      
> 4 tablespoons cold butter, diced      

* Toss filling ingredients together in a bowl and let stand until juicy ~ 30 minutes.
* Pour filling ingredients into a saucepan and cook over medium heat for ~20 minutes until tender.
* Preheat oven to 400°F.
* Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Blend in butter with your fingers until it becomes a coarse meal. * Slowly stir in buttermilk until mixture comes together like a wet paste. (If you don’t have buttermilk you can stir together regular milk and 1-2 teaspoons white vinegar and let stand until curdled, ~15 minutes).
* Sprinkle brown sugar on the bottom of a 9×13″ glass or ceramic dish. Pour filling ingredients over brown sugar and level with a spatula.
* Drop tablespoons of dough over filling leaving space between to allow topping to expand during baking. Sprinkle with brown sugar.
* Bake cobbler in middle of oven until topping is golden ~ 30 minutes.
* Cool slightly and serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream.
