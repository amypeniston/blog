*This dressing is just wow. Adjust quantities of lemon and garlic to taste. No one will every know there's no anchovy or parmesan cheese!*

> 1 cup unsalted cashews, soaked in hot/boiled water for at least 10 minutes     
> 5-7 cloves of garlic, crushed or minced     
> 1 tablespoon miso paste     
> juice of half a lemon     
> 1-2 tablespoons dijon mustard     
> 3-5 tablespoons olive oil     
> 1 teaspoon onion powder     
> 1-2 tablespoons garlic powder     
> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika     
> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes     
> 2-4 tablespoons nutritional yeast     
> 1 teaspoon salt + more to taste     
> 1 teaspoon black pepper + more to taste     
> water to reach desired consistency     

* Drain the cashews after they have soaked for at least 10 minutes in hot water.
* Combine all ingredients and blend until smooth using a high speed blender.  Add water to reach desired thickness- remember, it will thicken when chilled.
* Store in the fridge and add water or olive oil again before using if you need to loosen things up.
