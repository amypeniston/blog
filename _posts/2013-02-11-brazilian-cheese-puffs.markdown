*Adapted from a traditional Brazilian recipe, these tender little bread puffs are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. They are also very addictive!*
 
> 1 large egg (if your eggs are small, add a second egg white)   
> 1/3 cup olive oil      
> 2/3 cup milk      
> 1 1/2 cups tapioca flour      
> 3/4 – 1 cup grated cheese (favourite of mine: cheddar, gruyere, dubliner, parmesan mix)      
> 2 teaspoons dijon mustard      
> 2 teaspoons black pepper      
> 2 teaspoons garlic powder      
> 1 teaspoon white pepper      
> 2 teaspoons minced garlic      
> 1 teaspoon seasoning salt      
> 1 teaspoon sriracha      
> 1 teaspoon salt      

* Preheat the oven to 400°F and grease 2-3 mini muffin tins (~1.5″ openings) with cooking spray.
* Put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until smooth. The batter will be runny. Feel free to use your favorite types of cheese- I used a delicious blend of cheddar, gruyere, Irish dubliner and parmesan.
* Pour batter into muffin cups no more than 2/3 full. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until puffy and lightly browned on top (the bottoms will be darker). * Break open a tester to make sure that they are too gooey in the center.
* Remove from oven and let sit in tins for 1 minute. Serve warm or reheat in the toaster oven. They go really well spicy mustard or waterchestnut dip.
