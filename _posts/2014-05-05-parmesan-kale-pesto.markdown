*Love Bermuda kale! Pick it fresh, eat it often.*

> 1 large bunch of kale, cleaned, de-stemmed and chopped    
> block of Parmesan    
> lemon juice    
> 1/2 cup pine nuts or walnuts, toasted    
> garlic powder   
> salt & pepper to taste   
> olive oil   

* Steam the cleaned kale over simmering water for ~10 minutes until wilted and reduced in volume.
* Remove kale from heat and run under cold water briefly. Set aside.
* Meanwhile, toast the nuts until browned.
* Add kale, Parmesan (as desired), a splash of lemon juice, nuts and seasonings to the bowl of a food processor. Drizzle with olive oil and pulse until combined. Add more cheese and seasonings to suit your taste. Drizzle in more olive oil to reach the consistency youâ€™re looking for.
* Serve warmed with pasta and sauteed onions or spread on sandwiches/paninis. Pesto is so versatile! Be sure to store in fridge.
