*The perfect alternative to a thick, overly-rich frosting or buttercream. And it’s so versatile! It tastes great on maple or applesauce spice cupcakes.*

> 1 stick of butter, softened  
4 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon maple extract (if you don’t have extract, you may want to add more maple syrup. you’ll just have to taste it to find out!)

* Mix with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
* Use a spatula to transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate when not in use.
* Spread on muffins, cupcakes, bread, rice cakes, crumpets, french toast, and whatever else your heart desires.
