*Come on, how could you possibly make delicate, chewy, super easy snickerdoodles any better? Duh! Add coconut!*

Cookies:

> 1/2 cup butter, softened  
> 3 tablespoons shortening         
> 3/4 cup white sugar         
> 1 egg         
> 2 teaspoons vanilla         
> 1 1/2 cups flour         
> 1 teaspoon cream of tartar         
> 1 teaspoon baking soda         
> 1/4 teaspoon salt         
> 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon         
> 1 teaspoon ginger         
> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg         
> 1/2 teaspoon cloves         
> 3/4 cup coconut         

Rolling Mixture:

> 3 tablespoons white sugar     
> 2 teaspoons cinnamon     

* Cream together butter, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy.
* Add egg and vanilla and beat to combine.
* In a separate bowl whisk together dry ingredients.
* Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and blend only until combined. 
* Finally, stir in coconut.
* Let dough chill in fridge for 30 minutes. 
* Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F.
* Roll dough into tablespoon balls and coat in cinnamon sugar. 
* Place on greased cookie sheets and bake for 8-10 minutes. Do not overbake! As soon as edges start to get crispy, they’re ready to be taken out.
* Remove from oven and let cool 1 minute on cookie sheets. Let cool completely on a wire rack and enjoy with a hot earl grey tea. 

Yield: ~20 cookies.
