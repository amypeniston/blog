*Topped with toasted coconut, this frosting is a perfect accompaniment to a [Bacardi rum cake](/rum-cake-from-the-gods/).*

> 1 cup (2 sticks butter), softened  
> 2 3/4+ cups powdered sugar (to consistency- more for frosting, less for glaze)     
> 1/2 cup coconut milk (the fat, not the liquid portion, if using canned)     
> 1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract or coconut extract     

* Beat butter until light and fluffy.
* Mix in coconut milk and vanilla, then slowly start incorporating powdered sugar. Continue adding sugar until frosting reaches desired thickness.
