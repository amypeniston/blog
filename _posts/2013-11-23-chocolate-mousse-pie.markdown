*This recipe has only a few ingredients, making it very simple to throw together for a special event.*

Crust:

> 2-3 of your favorite cookies, crumbled (homemade or store-bought)  
1 store-bought pie crust (graham cracker is delicious)

Mousse:

> 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped  
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup cold heavy cream
3 large egg whites, room temperature
3/4 cup cold heavy cream

Whipped Cream Topping:

> 2 tablespoons white sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream
chocolate for garnish

* Crack 3 eggs and separate yolks, discarding or using for another dish. Allow the egg whites to come to room temperature in a small bowl.
* Open up your store-bought pie crust. Crush 2-3 of your favorite cookies and sprinkle cookie bits on the bottom of the pie crust. Set aside.
* Find a saucepan and a glass bowl that fits snugly on top to act as a double boiler. Fill the saucepan with 2 inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
* Place the chopped chocolate and 1/4 cup of cold cream in the double-boiler bowl and melt over heat, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula. Try not to get any moisture in the chocolate mixture as it will seize.
Once smooth, remove the chocolate mixture from the heat, and wipe the bottom of the bowl dry. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the filling ingredients.
* Beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form, approximately 1-2 minutes.
* Clean the beater attachments and wipe dry. In a separate bowl beat the remaining 3/4 cup of cold heavy cream until thick and fluffy, approximately 1-2 minutes.
* Add the whipped cream to the melted chocolate and use a rubber spatula to fold together. Try to be as light-handed as possible. Once the mixture is uniformly streaky with whipped cream, add the egg whites and continue to fold gently. Fold, fold, fold until there are no large blobs of white. Do not overmix!
* Spoon the mousse into the pie crust and smooth top. Stick the pie in the fridge to cool for approximately 2 hours, or until set.
* Just before youâ€™re ready to eat the pie, place a small metal bowl in your freezer and allow to chill for 10 minutes.
* Remove the bowl from your freezer and into it pour 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream, vanilla and sugar. Beat until soft peaks for, about 1-2 minutes.
* Spread the whipped cream over your chilled pie.
* To garnish, shave a piece of chocolate over your pie using a cheese grater or carrot peeler. Enjoy!
