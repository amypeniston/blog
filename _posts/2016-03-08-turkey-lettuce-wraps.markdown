*First time I made this recipe we ate the whole head of lettuce. THE WHOLE HEAD.*

> olive oil for sautéing     
> 1 pound ground turkey (can also use chicken)     
> 1 cup of mushrooms (you choose what type), minced     
> 1 can of water chestnuts, minced    
> 1/2 cup onion, minced    
> handful of scallions, minced    
> 5+ cloves garlic, minced    
> Stir Fry Sauce: combine 4 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon sesame oil     
> 1 head of butter lettuce    

* Heat olive oil in a pan until hot. Sautée ground turkey in the oil until browned, crumbling the meat as it cooks. Once cooked, place in a large bowl to cool.
* Add a little more olive oil to the pan and cook vegetables, starting with the mushrooms as they take the longest. Add in the water chestnuts, onion, scallions and garlic and sautée altogether. Finally, add the stir fry sauce and the cooked turkey. 
* Serve spoonfuls of the combined mixture in butter lettuce cups, dipping in the special sauces as desired.
