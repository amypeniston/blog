*A unique dish, flavored with dijon mustard and sprinkled with crisp bacon. It makes a delicious lunch when paired with a few pieces of fresh lettuce from the garden.* 

My own interpretation of a similar Polish dish on [Filozofia Smaku’s blog](http://filozofiasmaku.blogspot.com/2013/05/salatka-pieczarkowa.html#.UZfxjytxsVk).

> 3 eggs    
> 4-6 large white mushrooms    
> 1/2 cup Bermuda onion, chopped into 1/2″ chunks    
> 4 strips of crisp bacon, chopped    
> balsamic vinegar    
> olive oil    
> 1 tablespoon mayonaise    
> 1 tablespoon sour cream    
> 1-2 tablespoons dijon mustard    
> 1/3 cup sharp cheese, chopped into small cubes    
> salt & pepper to taste    
> lettuce    

* Hard boil your eggs by placing them in a small saucepan with enough water to cover. Add a splash of white vinegar to prevent eggs from cracking. Bring water to a boil over medium heat and boil eggs rapidly for 1 minute. Turn off heat and let sit in hot water for 7 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and place gently into ice cold water until cool enough to handle. 
* Preheat oven to 400°F. 
* Clean mushrooms and chop into small chunks. Arrange on a tin foil covered baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Roast in the oven for ~10 minutes, stirring as necessary to ensure even cooking. Mushrooms should be darkened but not crispy.
* Peel eggs and chop into rough chunks. You can choose to include or remove the yolk, to your liking. Place eggs, cheese cubes, onion, bacon, mayo, sour cream and dijon in a bowl and stir to combine.
* Remove mushrooms from the oven and let cool on tin foil. Once cool, stir into salad.
* Season with salt and pepper and serve over a bed of fresh lettuce. 

Makes ~2 servings.
