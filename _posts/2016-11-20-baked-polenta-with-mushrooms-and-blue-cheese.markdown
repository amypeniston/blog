*A creamy, molten side dish that's studded with hearty portobellos and topped with sharp nuggets of blue cheese.*

*Inspired by Ina Garten's recipe in her book "Make It Ahead"*

> 4-6 large portobellos, depending on the size of your baking dish     
> olive oil     
> balsamic vinegar      
> salt and pepper     
> 2 1/2 cups chicken stock     
> 2 cups half-and-half     
> 3/4 cup cornmeal     
> 1 tsp garlic powder     
> 1 tsp white pepper     
> generous 1/4 cup marscarpone cheese     
> 4 ounces gorgonzola cheese, crumbled     
> 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, optional      

* Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
* Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. De-stem the mushrooms and wipe with a paper towel to remove any dirt. Place them on a baking sheet, underside up, and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake for 20 minutes. Set aside; if desired, you can drain away some of the excess liquid that collects in the mushroom caps.
* Now, for the polenta: Combine chicken stock and half-and-half in a medium saucepan. Heat to boiling, then reduce to a simmer and whisk in cornmeal. Once incorporated, add the garlic powder and white pepper. Then switch to a wooden spoon and continue to stir until thick and smooth.
* Remove polenta from heat and stir in marscarpone and salt and pepper, to taste.
* Pour polenta into a baking dish and arrange mushrooms, underside up, on top. Sprinkle with gorgonzola crumbles and parmesan, if desired. Freshly ground pepper is a nice addition, too.
* Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the polenta and cheese is bubbly and slightly golden.
