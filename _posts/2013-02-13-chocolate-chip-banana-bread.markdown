*Whether as a loaf, jumbo muffins or mini muffin-bites, this is the best, richest banana bread I have ever tasted.*

> 1 cup butter, softened    
> 3/4 cup white sugar      
> 1 cup brown sugar      
> 2 large eggs      
> 5-6 overripe bananas, mashed      
> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract      
> 4 tablespoons mayonnaise      
> 1/2 teaspoon salt      
> 1 teaspoon baking powder      
> 2 teaspoons baking soda      
> 3 teaspoon cinnamon      
> 1 teaspoon ginger      
> 1 teaspoon cloves      
> 1 teaspoon nutmeg      
> 3 cups flour      
> 1/2 to 1 cup chocolate or peanut butter chips, as desired      
> 1/2 to 1 cup chopped walnuts, as desired      

Streusel Topping:

> 2 tablespoons flour   
> 2 tablespoons brown sugar     
> 1 tablespoon white sugar     
> 2 tablespoons butter, melted     
> 1 tablespoon cinnamon     
> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg     
> 1-2 tablespoons oatmeal     

* Preheat oven to 350°F. This recipe makes enough batter for 2 9×5″ loafs or at least 24 regular sized muffins. Decide which pans you’re using and grease them with cooking spray.
* Cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
* Beat in eggs one at a time.
* Combine mayo, mashed bananas and banana extract and beat into sugar mixture.
* Stir together dry ingredients and chocolate chips and beat into wet mixture. Don’t overmix! Coating the chips with flour helps to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread/cupcakes.
* Stir in walnuts as desired.
* If you’d like to add the brown sugar streusel topping, combine topping ingredients in a separate bowl.
* Pour batter into prepared pans, filling cups no more than 3/4 full. Top with streusel, if desired.
* Bake until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Careful not to overbake! Let cool in pan for 2 minutes and then remove to wire rack.
