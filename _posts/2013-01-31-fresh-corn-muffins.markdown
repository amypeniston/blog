*Golden yellow beauties studded with little kernels of fresh corn.*

> 1/2 cup butter, softened  
3/4 cup white sugar
4 tablespoons honey or agave nectar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup fresh or canned corn kernels

* Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line 12 muffin tins with paper cups and spray with cooking spray.
* In a bowl combine milk, cream and cornmeal and let sit for 10 minutes.
* In a separate bowl cream together butter and sugar for 3 minutes. 
* Add honey, eggs, and vanilla and beat to combine.
* In another bowl stir together salt, flour and baking powder.
* Add the wet cornmeal/milk/cream mixture to the bowl and mix.
* Beat dry ingredients into wet ingredients. The less you mix, the better.
* Finally, stir in corn kernels. Dry ingredients should be just incorporated.
* Fill 12 muffin cups with batter (~3/4 full).
* Bake for ~20 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Enjoy warm with jelly and cheese.
