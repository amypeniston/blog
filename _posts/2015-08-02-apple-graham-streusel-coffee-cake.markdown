*A lovely treat that makes your kitchen smell great too!*

Cake: 

> 1/2 cup butter, softened     
> 1 cup white sugar    
> 2 eggs    
> 1 cup sour cream    
> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract   
> 2 cups all-purpose flour   
> 1 teaspoon baking powder   
> 1 teaspoon baking soda   
> 1/4 teaspoon salt   

Topping/Filling:

> 1/4 cup white sugar    
> 1/3 cup packed brown sugar   
> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon   
> 3/4 cup walnuts, chopped   
> 3 tablespoons butter, melted   
> 1 apple, peeled and sliced thinly   

* Preheat the oven to 325°F.
* In a bowl, cream together butter and white sugar.
* Mix in eggs, sour cream and vanilla.
* In a separate bowl combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
* Add dry mixture to wet mixture and beat just until incorporated.
* In another bowl combine streusel ingredients.
* Grease and flour a pan (bundt or sheet, your choice).
* If you’re using a bundt pan: layer streusel on the bottom, top with half the batter. Then put another layer of streusel, a layer of apples and top with the remaining batter. If you’re using a sheet pan: start with half the batter, then a layer of streusel and a layer of apples. Top with the remaining batter and then finish with streusel.
* Bake for 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the cake comes out clean (don’t mistake the gooey center for uncooked batter!!).
* Slice and serve warm.
