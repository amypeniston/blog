*Thanks Ina, you've done it again.*

Tweaked from Ina Garten's [Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/jalapeno-cheddar-cornbread-recipe.html) recipe.

> 3 cups all-purpose flour    
> 1 cup yellow cornmeal       
> 1/4 cup sugar     
> 2 tablespoons baking powder     
> 2 teaspoons kosher salt     
> 2 cups milk, room temperature     
> 3 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten & room temperature          
> 2 sticks unsalted butter, melted & room temperature     
> 2 cups cheese, grated (good combo: 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1 cup jalapeno monterey jack)   
> 1/3 cup chopped scallions      
> 3 tablespoons seeded and diced fresh jalapeno peppers    

* Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl: flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt.
* Wisk together eggs, milk and butter. Leave out on counter, covered, until room temperature. This makes a difference!
* Mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients using a wooden spoon. Don't overmix, just 'till equally combined.
* Stir in cheese, scallions and jalapenos gently. 
* Let batter sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
* Preheat oven to 350Â°F, line a 9x13" glass pan with parchment paper and spray it with Pam.
* Pour batter into pan and top with additional cheese, if desired.
* Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
* Cut into generous squares and enjoy warm.
