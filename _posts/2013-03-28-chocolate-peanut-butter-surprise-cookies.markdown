*Soft on the outside and even softer on the inside- with a chewy, gooey chocolate center. Surprise!*

Inspired by [My San Francisco Kitchen](https://www.mysanfranciscokitchen.com/). Great site, be sure to check it out.

> ¼ cup white sugar  
¼ cup packed brown sugar  
⅓ cup peanut butter  
1 tbsp shortening
3 tbsp butter or margarine, softened
1 egg
¾ cup all-purpose flour  
¼ tsp baking soda  
¼ tsp baking powder
pinch salt
¼ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

* Take your peanut butter out of the fridge so it’s nice and soft.
* Cream butter, shortening and sugars until light and fluffy.
* Blend in peanut butter and eggs and mix well.
* Whisk together dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. 
* Add dry mixture and blend just until incorporated. The dough should just come together, without being overly crumbly or too sticky to handle. You can use a bit more egg white to help the mixture reach the right consistency.
* Remove dough from bowl and roll into a log. Wrap with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
* Near the end of the chilling time preheat the oven to 375°F.
* Remove the dough from the fridge and cut into 1/2 inch slices with a sharp knife.
* Place a few chocolate chips or a chunk of chopped chocolate in the center of each slice and form into a ball with your hands. Work quickly to keep the dough as chilled as possible (and prevent spreading!)
* Bake for 10-12 minutes (no more, or your cookies will get hard and dry out!) then cool on a wire cooling rack before serving.

Makes ~a dozen cookies.
