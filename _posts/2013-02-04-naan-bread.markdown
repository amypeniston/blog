*Warm, puffy and light, this bread pairs perfectly with a dollop of spicy hummus.* 

Adapted from [Manjula’s Kitchen](http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/2007/05/22/naan-bread/).

> 2 cups of flour  
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
3/4 cup lukewarm water

* In a small glass bowl, stir dry yeast into lukewarm water. Let it sit for 10 minutes or until the mixture becomes frothy. If things don’t seem to be happening, your yeast may be a dud or the water not lukewarm. 
* Add sugar, salt and baking soda to the flour and use your hands to mix well.
* Add the oil and sour cream to form a shaggy dough.
* Add the water/yeast mixture and make into soft dough.
* Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth (~10 minutes). Cover the dough and keep in a warm place for 3-4 hours. It should almost be double in volume.
* Heat the oven to 500 degrees with pizza stone for at least thirty minutes so stone is hot. If you don’t have a pizza stone you can use a large metal sheet pan sprinkled with flour.
* Turn the oven to high broil.
* Coat your hands lightly with olive oil and knead the dough for about two to three minutes.
* Divide the dough into six equal parts.
* Take each piece of dough, one at a time, and roll into 8-inch irregular ovals. You can lightly dust your work surface with four to help the rolling process. If you don’t have a rolling pin feel free to substitute any round object- a bottle of vodka, a can of food, a large jar etc. 
* Before putting the naan in oven, lightly wet your hands and flip the rolled naan between your palms. Place onto your baking/pizza stone and close the oven door (typically no more than 3 at a time).
* Cook for 3-5 minutes. Be sure to rotate the pan if it seems that one section of the bread is browning faster than the rest. The goal is a light golden color with spots of darker brown.
* Take naan out of the oven and brush lightly with butter or garlic and enjoy with freshly made hummus.
