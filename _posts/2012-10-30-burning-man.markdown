My first foray into movie editing! After shooting some incredible footage in the tempestuous Black Rock Desert, Nevada at Burning Man 2012, I compiled an unofficial music video for DJ Seven Lions' song "Still With Me".

Videography by Scott Stallard.

And if you're ever given the opportunity to attend Burning Man, do it. Life changer. Although I'd suggest waiting until next year (2016) as I hear there's a [nasty insect blight](http://gizmodo.com/weve-identified-those-bugs-infesting-burning-man-and-1725287661) going on right now!
