*I know, yeast is scary, but I promise the ooey-gooey-cheesiness of this bubble bread is worth the hassle.*

Dough:

> 1/4 cup lukewarm water    
> 1 cup lukewarm milk      
> 1 tablespoon honey      
> 2 tablespoons olive oil      
> 1 large egg, beaten      
> 2 teaspoons yeast      
> 1 teaspoon salt      
> 1+ cup grated cheddar cheese      
> 3 1/4 – 3 3/4 cups flour      

Filling:

> olive oil   
> garlic, finely minced     
> cheddar, grated     
> other great additions: white pepper, red pepper flakes, cayenne     

* Pour yeast and lukewarm water into a plastic bowl or glass measuring cup. One of the keys with yeast is to make sure you don’t scorch it right from the beginning- so, make sure you stick your finger in the measuring cup of water before you combine it with the little yeasties.
* Let yeast bloom for 5 minutes. If you don’t see clouds of happily growing yeast you’ve either killed it or your yeast was old. Dump out the bowl and try again.
* Add the warm milk (not hot!!), honey and olive oil to the yeast.
* Beat the egg in a large plastic bowl and then add to it the yeast/milk mixture. Beat to combine.
* Add the flour cup by cup, stirring briskly between additions. After 3 cups, slow down and start kneading with your hands. The goal is a dough that is still slightly sticky.
* Knead until smooth and elastic, at least 10 minutes. Fight through the pain!
* Cover the bowl and let dough sit for 10 minutes.
* While you’re waiting combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl, adjusting quantities of garlic, cheese and spices to taste. You’ll be using the oil as an adhesive to coat the dough balls.
* Once you have let the dough rest, use your hands to break off approximately 14 golf ball sized chunks. Roll them into balls and dip them in the filling.
* Place balls into a large baking dish or pan and allow to rise for 30 minutes. Cover with greased plastic wrap to prevent stickage. At the end of this period preheat the oven to 400°F.
* Remove plastic wrap and bake for 20-25 minutes. The bread should be hard and hollow-sounding when tapped lightly. Enjoy warm with butter and jam.
