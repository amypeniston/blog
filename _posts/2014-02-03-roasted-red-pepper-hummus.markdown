*Not as spicy as my [classic hummus recipe](/the-best-hummus), but just as delicious.*

> 1 can chick peas    
> 4 roasted red peppers out of a jar    
> 1-2 tablespoons salt    
> 5 tablespoons lemon juice    
> 2 tablespoons cumin    
> 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper    
> 1/2 tsp roasted red pepper flakes    
> 1 tablespoon hot pepper (crushed) in a jar    
> 2 tablespoons sriracha    
> 1 tablespoon minced garlic    
> juice from the can of chick peas, reserved    
> olive oil    

* Combine ingredients (through minced garlic) in a food processor and pulse to combine.
* Slowly drizzle in reserved chick pea liquid and olive oil to reach desired consistency.
