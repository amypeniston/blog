*Huge success with a modified version of Martha’s Ginger Molasses cupcakes. Great texture and a true-to-tradition gingerbread taste.*

> 3 cups all-purpose flour (although bread flour works just fine)   
> 2 teaspoons baking soda     
> 1 teaspoon salt     
> 1 1/2 cups sugar     
> 2/3 cup molasses     
> 2 eggs     
> 1 cup butter, melted     
> 1/3 cup hot water     
> 1 5-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced     
> 1 teaspoon ground ginger     

* Preheat oven to 350° F. Line muffin tins with liners and grease with cooking spray.
* Whisk together flour, baking soda, ground ginger and salt. 
* In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, molasses and eggs until smooth. 
* Add melted butter and hot water to wet mixture. 
* Stir dry mixture into wet until just incorporated. 
* Fold in fresh ginger by hand.
* Fill muffin cups (no more than 2/3 full or you’ll have the batter overflow onto the pan!).
* Bake for 25 minutes, or until centers are set and tester comes out clean. A dollop of homemade whipped cream goes great on top!
