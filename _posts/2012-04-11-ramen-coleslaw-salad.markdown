*Everyone loves this salad. Itâ€™s the occasional crunch from the ramen, the tanginess of the vinegar, the healthy medley of marinated veggies...Try it and see.*

Into a small bowl combine and marinate in the fridge, 30 mins:

> onion, chopped into small pieces   
> bell pepers (multiple colors!), chopped into small pieces     
> banana peppers, chopped     
> hot pepper, chopped     
> generous glug glug of olive oil     
> 2 tablespoons lemon juice     
> salt & pepper     

Into a large bowl combine:

> 1 package ramen, crumbled    
> 1 ramen seasoning pouch     
> carrots, shredded     
> cabbage, cut into thin strips or chunks     
> celery, chopped into small rounds     
> several tablespoons of rice wine vinegar/apple cider vinegar     
> veggie meat, chopped     

* After veggies have marinated, combine with slaw. Stir and add more olive oil to taste. 
* Let salad sit in fridge, covered. It gets better overnight!
