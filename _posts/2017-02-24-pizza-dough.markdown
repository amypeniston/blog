*At last - the crispy, thin crust pizza base that I have been searching for.*

> 7/8 - 1 cup warm water     
> 1 teaspoon sugar     
> 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast     
> 1 teaspoon salt     
> 2 1/2 cup flour     

* 1 hour beforehand: remove yeast from fridge and let acclimate to room temperature.
* Combine water, sugar and yeast in a small bowl and leave for 10-15 minutes until frothy. The yeast should activate in the water and "look alive". If they don't, they may be dead or not yet acclimated to room temperature or your water may have been too hot/cold.
* Whisk activated yeast mixture, salt and 1 cup of flour in a large plastic bowl. Switch to a wooden spoon and continue adding flour in 1/2 cup increments until dough forms a shaggy mass. Start kneading with your hands. After 5 minutes, let the dough rest for a minute or two before starting to knead again. Keep going until the ball is smooth and elastic.
* Pat flour on the ball and place in a sealed ziplock in a warm spot for 45 minutes.
* Remove from bag, split into two balls, re-seal the bag and place into the fridge for up to 72 hours.
* Take dough out at least 30 minutes before use.

*Makes enough dough for two pizzas*

## Making the Pizza
* Remove dough from fridge at least 30 minutes in advance. Preheat oven to 550Â°F.
* In a small bowl, combine a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and fresh minced garlic. Set aside for later.
* Drizzle olive oil on two pizza pans and smush it around with your hands to evenly coat.
* Remove ball numero uno from bag. Hold the dough in the air and gently start spreading it out. No need to toss it, but hey, be my guest. Once roughly circular, place it on a pan and start spreading outward. Flatten, spread, flatten, spread, rotating the pan as you go. Once it's nice and evenly flat, move on to the remaining ball.
* Using a brush or the back of a spoon, coat pizzas with the garlic/olive oil mixture.
* Bake dough bases for 5-10 minutes, or until golden and starting to crisp.
* Remove from oven, top with desired toppings (sauce/pesto, cheese, veggies, pepperoni etc. etc.).
* Bake again for 10-15 minutes (check frequently as ovens vary). Move the pizzas around to achieve desired doneness on bottom and top.
* EAT.
