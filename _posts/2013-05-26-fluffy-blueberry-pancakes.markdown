*Golden pancakes studded with fresh, plump blueberries and drizzled with Vermont maple syrup- little clouds of deliciousness.* 

Inspired by [Williams-Sonoma’s recipe](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/blueberry-pancakes.html).

> 2 cups flour    
> 3 tablespoons sugar    
> 2 teaspoons baking powder    
> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda    
> 1/2 teaspoon salt    
> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten    
> 1 3/4 cups milk    
> 2 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for pan    
> 1 1/2 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen- if frozen, don’t let thaw)    
> butter, maple butter, cinnamon, maple syrup    

* In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until well mixed.
* Pour the eggs, the milk and the 2 tablespoons melted butter into the dry ingredients, then gradually whisk from the center outward, until the ingredients are well combined but still a little lumpy; do not over mix! You don’t want heavy pancakes!
* Very gently stir in the blueberries. The batter will be quite thick.
* Preheat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat until a drop of water flicked onto the surface evaporates instantly. Brush griddle with butter using a paintbrush. Ladle rounds of batter onto the griddle.
* Cook pancakes until golden on both sides, flipping as needed.
* Keep pancakes warm in the oven at 200ºF until ready to eat.
* Serve pancakes on warmed plates and top with whipped butter, cinnamon, maple syrup or your favorite toasted nuts.
