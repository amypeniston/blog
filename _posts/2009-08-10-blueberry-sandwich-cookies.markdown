*Make these with freshly-picked blueberries for a festive and seasonal treat*

Cookies:

> 1/2 cup butter     
> 1 cup sugar      
> 2 eggs      
> 1 tablespoon vanilla      
> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour      
> 1/2 teaspoon salt      
> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda      

Filling:

> 2 cups blueberries, fresh is best!    
> 2/3 cup sugar     
> 2/3 cup cold water     
> 1 teaspoon lemon juice     
> 1 tablespoon cornstarch     

* In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
* Beat in eggs, and vanilla. 
* In another bowl, whisk together dry ingredients. 
* Add dry mixture to creamed mixture. 
* Cover and refrigerate dough while you make the filling.
* In a saucepan, combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice and 1/3 cup of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently.
* In a measuring cup, combine the remaining 1/3 cup of water and cornstarch, stirring to combine. 
* Continue to cook blueberry filling until blueberries lose their shape and mixture begins to thicken (at least 15 minutes). 
* Gradually add cornstarch mixture to saucepan, stirring to combine. Allow to boil for at least 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool.
* Preheat oven to 375°F. 
* Remove dough from the fridge and divide it in half. Then, on a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8" thickness. 
* Time to be creative! These jam-filled sandwiches will need bottoms as well as tops; the tops should have some sort of a hole or "window" to showcase the pretty blueberry filling. I chose to use a square cookie-cutter for the main shape and a maple leaf cookie-cutter to create the window. Once you cut out your tops and bottoms from the initial rolled dough, collect the scraps and re-roll until all has been used. 
* Place bottoms and tops on ungreased cookie sheets (don’t worry about spacing, they don’t expand much) and bake for 10 minutes. The edges should be **just** browning; do not overbake. 
* Remove to racks and allow to cool completely.
* When you are ready to assemble, place a dollop of filling on a cookie bottom and spread it evenly with a knife. Place a cookie top on the filling and press lightly to close. 

Recipe makes ~15 cookies, plus the center cutouts and a little bit of extra blueberry filling for dipping.
