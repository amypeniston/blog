*Topped with toasted bread and gooey cheese- you’ll want to eat this sweet, chunky onion soup by the gallon!*

Adapted from [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2011/04/french-onion-soup/).

> 5 1/2 cups thinly sliced onions  
2 shallots, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons celery seed
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 bay leaves
3 tablespoons flour
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups chicken broth
2 chicken/beef bouillon cubes
1/2 cup dry white vermouth (or dry white wine)
1 tablespoon black pepper, plus more to taste
3 tablespoons cognac (or brandy)

To finish:

> grated raw onion  
1/2 cup grated cheddar
1/4 cup cubed alpine lace
1/4 cup shaved parmesan
butter, cubed
bread, toasted
(Feel free to use whatever types of cheese you please, and in the quantity you like!)

* Melt butter and oil together in a large saucepan over low heat. Add onions and stir to coat with butter/oil. Cover the pot and let simmer for 20 minutes.
* Uncover the pot and stir in salt, celery seed, oregano, shallots and sugar. Raise the heat ever so slightly and simmer 40 minutes to an hour, stirring frequently. The longer you let the onions caramelize, the better this soup will be. The goal is a deep, golden brown color that smells absolutely heavenly. Don’t rush perfection!! If the onions start to get too dry, replace the lid for several minutes.
* After the onions are caramelized, add the flour and cook for 3 minutes. The flour will soak up a lot of the excess liquid so keep stirring to prevent the mixture from burning.
* Add the wine, then incorporate broth and stock bit by bit, stirring between additions. Add bouillon cubes.
* Season with salt and pepper to taste and add bay leaves. Don’t overdo the salt- the bread and cheese will add saltiness at the end.
* Stir in cognac.
* Bring soup to a simmer and stir occasionally for another 30 – 40 minutes, partially covered, or until desired consistency is reached.
* Preheat oven to 350°F. Bring soup to a boil and pour into soup bowls arranged on a foil-covered pan/baking sheet (watch out for the bay leaves!). * Stir in grated raw onion and a dollop of mixed cheese into each bowl. Top with toasted bread and cubed butter, attempting to completely cover the top of the soup. Cover the bread with cheese and sprinkle with pepper.
* Bake soups for 10 minutes then broil for 5 minutes till the cheese is brown and bubbly.

Makes 4-5 servings.
