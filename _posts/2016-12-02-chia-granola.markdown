*Nutty, crunchy, sweet, satisfying...this granola is a lighter alternative to the heavy peanut butter variety often found in grocery stores or frozen yogurt bars.*

> 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats     
> 1 cup grape nuts cereal      
> 1/4 cup ground flax seeds     
> 1/2 cup ground oats     
> 1/2 cup coconut sugar (or brown sugar)     
> 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon     
> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg     
> 1/2 teaspoon salt     
> dash of turmeric, optional     
> 1/2 cup melted coconut oil (or vegetable oil)      
> 1 tablespoon molasses     
> 1 tablespoon honey     
> 1 egg white, beaten     
> 1 tablespoon almond extract     
> 1 cup coconut flakes, toasted     

* Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
* In a large bowl, stir together oats, grape nuts, ground flax seeds, ground oats, coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and turmeric.
* In a second bowl, whisk together coconut oil, molasses, honey and egg white.
* Pour wet ingredients into dry mixture and stir till until evenly moistened.
* Spread mixture over parchment paper using a spatula and pat flat.
* Bake for 45-55 minutes or until edges start to brown. Do not stir! Remove from oven and let cool completely on the baking sheet (this will help large granola clusters to form).
* Pour cooled granola into an airtight container and stir in coconut flakes, if desired. Store in the fridge and enjoy with fresh fruit and berries over yogurt.
