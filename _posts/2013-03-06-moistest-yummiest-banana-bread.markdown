*This banana bread is very moist and crunchy on the top, thanks to the brown sugar and walnuts topping. Here in Bermuda, we have an abundance of bananas during the spring and I decided to try every banana recipe I could get my hands on. After many attempts, this is THE WINNER!*

For the bottom of the pan:

> 1/3 cup brown sugar       
> 1 teaspoon cinnamon     
> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (if desired)     

For the cake:

> 3/4 cup white sugar       
> 1/2 cup brown sugar     
> 1/2 cup vegetable oil     
> 2 eggs, beaten     
> 1/3 cup buttermilk     
> 1 cup mashed bananas     
> 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour     
> 1 teaspoon baking soda     
> 3+ teaspoons cinnamon     
> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg     
> 1/2 teaspoon cloves     
> 1/2 teaspoon salt     

Note: If you don’t have buttermilk, add a drop of white vinegar or lemon juice to just under a 1/3 cup of milk. Stir and wait 5-10 minutes.

* Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray one 9×5 inch loaf pan or bundt pan with non-stick spray coating and sprinkle bottom with brown sugar, cinnamon and walnuts.
* Blend together the sugars, oil, eggs, buttermilk and bananas.
* Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Add to banana mixture. Mix until moistened.
* Pour into prepared loaf pan and bake 50-60 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from pan to cool. The top should be sticky to the touch.
* Store in a zip-lock bag or a container to prevent bread from drying out.
