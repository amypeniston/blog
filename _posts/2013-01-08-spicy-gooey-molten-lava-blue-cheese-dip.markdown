*A stick-to-your-innards crowd-pleaser that pairs with chips, veggies, pita or even chicken wings.*

Adapted from the [NY Times recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013023-spicy-molten-blue-cheese-dip).

> 1 package of cream cheese (8 ounces)   
> 1/4 cup goats cheese, softened      
> 4 garlic cloves, minced      
> 1/4 cup heavy cream      
> 1/4 cup mayonnaise      
> 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce      
> 1+ teaspoon hot sauce      
> 3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese      
> 2 tablespoons chopped chives      
> salt, black pepper and white pepper, to taste      
> finger foods, ex: carrots, celery, chips, pita wedges, chicken wings      

* Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.
* Place softened cream cheese in the food processor and pulse until it forms a smooth paste. Add the goats cheese and pulse again to combine.
* Mince the garlic and then mash together with a pinch of salt. Place into the food processor with cream, mayo, worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and peppers. Run food processor until mixture is smooth.
* Add the blue cheese and chives and pulse just until combined. The chunks of the blue cheese give this dip its signature texture.
* Scoop mixture into a gratin dish and bake until the dip is like molten lava: melted and bubbling (~30-40 minutes).
* Remove from oven and sprinkle with extra hot sauce, cayenne pepper or sriracha, if desired. Serve with finger munchies.
