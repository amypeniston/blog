*All Bermudians love scones; call us old-fashioned, call us British, but nothing pairs better with a hot cup of tea.*

Scones:

> 3/4 cup raisins  
3-4 tablespoons rum, HOT!
2 cups flour
4 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup cold butter, cubed
3/4 cup buttermilk

 

Topping:

> 3 tablespoons buttermilk  
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

* Preheat oven to 425ÂºF and microwave 3-4 tablespoons of Bacardi Gold Rum until hot. Soak raisins in rum while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. This makes your raisins plump and delicious. (+1 for using rum in a scone recipe, Amy).
* Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl.
* Using your fingers, blend in butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal with only small, pea-sized lumps.
* Drain any excess liquid from the raisins and then mix with your hands into the dough.
* Pour in buttermilk (slowly!) until dough comes together. It should be sticky but not pourable like brownie batter. You may not need to use all 3/4 cup of buttermilk.
* Form a ball out of the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured board.
Knead -briefly- no more than 1 minute.
* Roll or pat out to 3/4 inch thick. Using a floured cookie cutter or the rim of a glass, cut circles in the dough.
* Place circles at least 1 inch apart on a greased or parchment-paper-lined baking sheet.
* Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk and sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon blend.
* Bake in the center of your oven about 15 minutes (rotating pans if necessary) or until nicely browned. Remove from pans to cooling racks.
* Crack these babies open and serve warm with a great big dollops of jam.
