Homemade black bean veggie burgers loaded with oats, onions, peppers and spices, topped with caramelized onions, mozzarella and tomato. Served on a bed of lettuce and soft neo tuscan boule.  

> 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed    
> 1 cup diced mushrooms    
> 3/4-1 cup plain rolled oats    
> 3 cloves garlic, chopped    
> 1 egg, lightly beaten    
> 2 Tbsp cumin    
> 2 tsp ground black pepper    
> 2 tsp garlic powder    
> 1 tsp salt    
> 1/4 cup onion, diced    
> 1/4 cup bell pepper, diced    
> 2 tsp olive oil    
> buns or fresh bread    
> condiments    
> fresh lettuce    
> fresh tomato    
> caramelized onion    
> cheese    

Preheat grill or ready a large skillet on the stove. Place beans, mushrooms, oats, garlic, egg and spices in a food processor. Pulse until well mixed. Add onions and bell peppers and pulse until combined. Form into patties (makes about 7)- the mixture will be very sticky and wet.
Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side or fry in hot oil. Patties should brown and firm up.
Toast buns or bread, if desired. Serve bean burgers on a bed of lettuce topped with condiments, tomatoes, cheese and hot caramelized onions.
