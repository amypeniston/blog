*The hottest, smoothest, tastiest hummus you’ll ever make.*

> 1 can chick peas (reserve some of the liquid)  
1 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp tumeric (for a yellow-colored hummus)
3+ tsp cumin
1 large blob (2-3 tablespoons) tahini
generous shake shake of salt
1 hot red pepper
handful of chopped chives
1 roasted pepper from a jar (~1/2 cup)
3 tablespoons lemon juice
5 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
3+ tablespoons olive oil
3-5 tablespoons sriracha
a few shakes of red pepper flakes

* Blend ingredients in a food processor until smooth. As a general rule you’ll need to add a bit more liquid than what I’ve written above. For this you have a few options: if you prefer a stronger taste of lemon in your hummus, use lemon juice to get the mixture to the right consistency. Otherwise you can olive oil for a creamier hummus or chick pea liquid if you just want to preserve the flavors. Also- a few more drops of cider vinegar can give the hummus a nice twang.

My suggestion is to use this recipe as a base and tailor it to your personal preference or the crowd you’re serving. Add more heat, add more tartness, it’s up to you!
