*Sweet, crunchy and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Whip these up in 20 minutes flat for a very easy and delicious Asian side dish- Steph's favorite! Love you Steph.*

> 5 tablespoons soy sauce     
> 1 heaping tablespoon of brown sugar     
> 3 teaspoons sesame oil     
> 2 teaspoons rice vinegar     
> 2 teaspoons sriracha       
> 1 teaspoon garlic powder     
> 1 teaspoon ginger (ground or fresh)      
> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes         
> 5 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed         
> carrots, chopped into rounds or long logs       
> broccoli, chopped into florets         
> 2 teaspoons sesame seeds         
> handful of scallions, chopped into rounds           

*A note about quantities of vegetables: adjust the amount of carrots and broccoli as you desire. More veggies = a drier final product. The total should be around 3-5 cups of carrots and broccoli combined.*

* Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking pan with foil and spray with pam.
* Whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sriracha, garlic powder, ginger, red pepper flakes and fresh garlic.
* Option 1: If you're using bigger pieces of carrots and would like them softer rather than crunchier, throw them on the pan, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 8-10 minutes by themselves. Meanwhile combine the sauce and the broccoli and let sit while the carrots cook. After the 8-10 minutes, add the broccoli mixture to the pan, stir to distribute the sauce and bake.
* Option 2: If you want your carrots to be crunchy, combine them and the broccoli, pour the sauce over the veggies and stir to combine. Turn out everything (carrots, broccoli and sauce) onto the pan and bake.
* Watch vegetables carefully and remove from oven when desired doneness is reached, around 20-25 minutes. 
* Remove from oven and stir in sesame seeds and scallions. Serve immediately. This dish goes really well with [Turkey Lettuce Wraps](/turkey-lettuce-wraps/).
