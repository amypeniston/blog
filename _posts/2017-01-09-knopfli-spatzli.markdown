*Delightful little nuggets of Swiss pasta that are fun to eat and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe, Aunt Annemarie.*

> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour     
> 1 teaspoon salt     
> dash of nutmeg     
> 1/2 cup water     
> 1/2 cup milk     
> 3 eggs     

* Let milk, water and eggs come to room temperature while you fill a large pot with salted water and rinse your [Spätzli lid](https://www.amazon.com/Kuchenprofi-Spaetzle-Scraper-Stainless-Steel/dp/B000NLLG7C), which I am sure is covered in dust from lack of use.
* Sift flour, salt and nutmeg into a large bowl. Yes, sifting is necessary for a perfectly smooth batter.
* Whisk together water, milk and eggs, then add to the dry ingredients.
* Beat with a wooden spoon until bubbles form, about 8-10 minutes, or until your arm falls off.
* Cover the bowl with a dishcloth and let sit for 30 minutes in a warm spot.
* Bring the large pot of water to a boil and place your grated Spätzli lid on the inside lip of the pot.
* Once the water is boiling, quickly pour and spread batter over the lid, scraping it through the holes and into the water. Work speedily so that all the pasta pieces cook for as close to the same amount of time as possible.
* Remove the lid and watch as the little pastas bob to the surface. Once the majority have risen, drain pot into a colander.

Spätzli is traditionally enjoyed with a simple drizzle of olive oil or pad of butter and fresh parmesan cheese. We use it in a variety of marinara, pesto and alfredo dishes, since it's so damn satisfying to make pasta from scratch. You can even sauté it with vegetables.

This recipe makes quite a bit of Spätzli, around 4 cups or so. Store in an airtight container in the fridge. Eat often.
