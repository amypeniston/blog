*High in protein and intensely flavorful thanks to the addition of a slow-smoked onion, this homemade seitan is better than anything you'll find in a store.*

## Seitan Ingredients

> 1 cup vital wheat gluten     
> 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast     
> 1-2 tablespoons garlic powder     
> 1 tablespoon onion powder     
> 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes     
> 1 onion, slow-smoked on the BBQ and purÃ©ed or 1/2 cup vegetable broth     
> 1 teaspoon liquid aminos or soy sauce     

* You may need to add a bit more liquid to make the dough come together. You can either use more vegetable broth or water.

## Broth ingredients

You have two options for broth. One uses bouillon cubes, the other broth.

**Option 1**

> 4 vegetable bouillon cubes     
> 8 cups boiling water     
> 1/4 cup liquid aminos or soy sauce     

**Option 2**

> 4 cups vegetable broth
> 4 cups boiling water
> 1/4 cup liquid aminos or soy sauce      

* Combine broth ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil.
* In a large bowl, whisk together vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper flakes. Add in onion (or vegetable broth) and liquid aminos and stir with a wooden spoon until all dry ingredient incorporated. The dough will look odd and be strangely spongy/rubbery. Knead for 5-10 minutes or until you can't take it any more.
* Turn dough blob out onto counter and cut into pieces. Two options here, keeping in mind that the pieces will expand when boiled. Big 2-3 inch hunks will be more like "steaks" or "burgers" whereas 1 inch hunks will be more like "meatballs". Chop as desired.
* Your broth should be boiling by now. Carefully lower seitan pieces into the broth and bring back to a boil. Then cover, reduce heat and simmer for about an hour.
* Store seitan in an airtight container in the fridge, covered with the broth. The broth also makes a great soup base and will make your house smell amazing.

*Recipe makes about 1 pound of seitan.*
