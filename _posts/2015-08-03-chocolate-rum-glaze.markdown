*An alternative to the traditional plain white sugar glaze that typically adorns a [Bacardi rum cake](/rum-cake-from-the-gods/).*

> 2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips    
> 2 tablespoons butter   
> 2 tablespoons milk   
> 2+ tablespoons rum  

* Set up a double boiler to melt the chocolate chips by resting a glass bowl on top of a saucepan filled with boiling water. Add all 4 ingredients and stir frequently.
* Allow the chocolate mixture to simmer for 5 minutes. The goal is a shiny, smooth glaze that is perfectly drizzle-able. Too thick and you need to add more rum (or milk); too thin and you need to add more chocolate chips.
* Remove the glaze from heat and let cool until just warm to the touch. 

This stuff is a fantastic accompaniment to pancakes, brownies and, of course, [rum cake](/rum-cake-from-the-gods/).
