*Crunchy little haystacks of golden coconut with chewy centers and chocolate bottoms- good luck having just one!*

Inspired by Joyofbaking.com.

Macaroons:

> 2 large eggs, room temperature    
> 1/2 cup granulated white sugar    
> 1/8 teaspoon salt    
> 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract    
> 3 cups sweetened coconut    

Dipping Chocolate:

> 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped    
> 1 tablespoon butter    

* Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
* Whisk together eggs until nice and frothy, then add sugar salt, and coconut extract.
* Stir in shredded coconut until completely moistened. It will be very sticky!
* Drop small mounds (about 1 tablespoon) onto the parchment-lined baking sheets.
* Bake for about 14 to 18 minutes or until golden brown on top. Don’t overbake- they’ll get hard and lose their moistness.
* Meanwhile, combine chocolate and butter in a double boiler and melt over low heat. Don’t use high heat- you’re chocolate will seize and becoming very difficult to work with! If this happens, add a smidge of warm milk to loosen things up.
* Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.
* Dip the bottom of each macaroon in the melted chocolate.
* Place the macaroons, chocolate side down, on a parchment lined baking sheet and refrigerate until the chocolate hardens. Store in an airtight container or in the fridge if you live in a warm climate. 

Makes ~24 macaroons.
