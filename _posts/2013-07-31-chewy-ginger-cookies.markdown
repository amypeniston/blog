*For those of us who prefer chewy, not snappy, when it comes to ginger cookies.*

> 2 1/4 cups flour    
> 2 tsp ground ginger    
> 1 tsp baking soda    
> 2 tsp ground cinnamon    
> 1 tsp ground cloves    
> 1/4 tsp salt    
> 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced finely    
> 3/4 cup butter, softened    
> 1 cup white sugar    
> 1 egg    
> 1 tablespoon water    
> 1/4 cup molasses    
> white sugar to coat    

* Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
* Beat in egg, then water and molasses. Scrape sides of bowl as needed.
* Sift together dry ingredients in a separate bowl.
* Pour dry ingredients and minced ginger into wet ingredients and blend just until combined.
* Let mixture rest in fridge for 1 hour. At the end of the cooling time preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
* Remove dough from oven and let sit on counter while you spray cookie sheets with cooking spray.
* Shape dough into golf ball size spheres and roll in white sugar to coat. Place 2 inches apart on sheets and flatten with the bottom of a drinking glass.
* Bake for 8-11 minutes or until just slightly cracked on top. Allow to cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool fully. Store in an airtight container and enjoy with a hot cup of tea.
