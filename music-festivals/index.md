I was never a big music lover until I went to my first music festival: Bonnaroo in 2012. There was something about the experience of coming together with people from all around the world to celebrate incredible artists that hooked me. Planning routes to the venues, packing my pickup truck with camping gear, setting up a tent next to two new sets of friends...I truly believe it's an experience everyone needs to try at least once.

Since 2012, I have been all across the world with old friends and new, sleeping in tents and RVs, sharing watermelons with neighbors, discovering new artists and on and on...
