One of my passions is going to music festivals. Especially the camping ones, where you stay in a dirty, sweaty tent and meet neighbors from all around the world. 

### What to bring?

Needless to say I've whittled down a list of highly necessary items that I am sure to bring whenever I hit the road. Here's what works for me:
